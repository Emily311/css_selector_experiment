    <p>ðŸŽµNEUTRAL LIFE</p>
    <p>STOLENç§˜å¯†è¡ŒåŠ¨</p>
    <p>In new true life
      you've got nothing to lose
      beg for something you need
      that they can not see
      waste no time
      mix the lies with the truth
      n' watch it melt into emptiness
      Iburn that clown
      tho he pushed me away from the rotting abyss
      that I couldn't leave
      make a lie
      I don't want to be saved
      I just want to remain where I feel safe
      create a new life
      then drop it to die again and again reapeat
      they swallow my life and suck it 'til dry
      hang me on the steel arm of a crane
      follow the tide
      its flooded by fate
      this life is reality
      living the lie you pray for new life
      everything has a destiny
      In new true life
      you've got nothing to lose
      beg for something you need
      that they can not see</p>

      <p>ðŸŽµSadness is Rebellion</p>
      <p>Lebanon Hanover</p>
      <p>You say nostalgia is negation
        It can't go on like that
        It will all end
        Contentment to be in nature
        And kindness is still so hard to find
        Sadness is Rebellion
        And self hate only respect
        There is waves of resistance
        Somewhere out there
        But there's not enough of them
        Those graves are such a temptation
        If we don't press rewind it will all end
        You say popular music is contamination
        It won't stop if the public is too blind
        Sensitivity almost a sensation
        In a world of cruel and simple minds
        May teardrops be our revolution
        In confusion we will connect
        There is waves of resistance
        I can feel them but I never hear of them
        There is waves of resistance
        The critical minds there is not enough of them</p>
